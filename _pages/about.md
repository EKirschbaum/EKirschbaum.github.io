I am interested in developing machine learning methods for applications in different scientific disciplines. During my PhD I have developed machine learning algorithms to improve the analysis of neurophysiological data. My main focus was on the analysis of calcium imaging data and the detection of repeating motifs in neuronal activity, so-called neuronal assemblies or functional ensembles. My PhD was mainly funded by [SFB 1134](http://sfb1134.uni-heidelberg.de/), which brought together world-leading experts on neuronal assemblies. This gave me the amazing opportunity to work on joint research projects at the interface between machine learning and neuroscience.
