Engagement
===
* __Member of a Calcium-Imaging-Self-Help-Group__ (since 2017)   
The Calcium-Imaging-Self-Help-Group was founded by neuroscientists within the [SFB 1134](http://sfb1134.uni-heidelberg.de) to discuss and exchange experience with data acquisition and analysis when using calcium imaging. I joined this group in order to offer my help with the data analysis and to introduce our motif detection methods. The discussions with the neuroscientists were of great benefit for my work as they revealed which steps of the data analysis were particularly problematic and also inspired me to come up with new approaches.

* __Member of the Upstream Network__ (since 2016)   
[Upstream](http://www.mathcomp.uni-heidelberg.de/programs/upstream/) is a network for women in mathmatics and related subjects funded by the Heidelberg Graduate School [HGS MathComp](http://www.mathcomp.uni-heidelberg.de). I actively participated in different workshops, excursions and other events of the network. 

* __Organiser of an (informal) WISTEM Group__ (since 2016)  
Shortly after arriving in Heidelberg I joined a networking and mentoring workshop for women in mathmatics and related subjects. The exchange with the other participants was really inspiring and helpful, so we decided to stay in touch after the workshop. Since then I have been organising a weekly breakfast, monthly meetings for dinner and various social events for the growing group of female PhD students and PostDocs. 

* __Mentor for Exchange Student__ (2014)  
As a mentor I helped an exchange student with administrative things and tried to make the start at TÃ¼bingen University easier for the student.

* __Co-Organiser of a Seminar for Exchange Students__ (2013)  
In a film seminar for exchange students we watched German movies and discussed them afterwards. I presented suggestions for movies to watch and discussed the historical, social and political background of the movies with the participants.
